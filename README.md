### Creational Design Patterns
Creational design patterns provide solution to instantiate a object in the best possible way for specific situations
#### Singleton-Pattern
To implement a Singleton pattern, we have different approaches but all of them have the following common concepts.

- Private constructor to restrict instantiation of the class from other classes.
- Private static variable of the same class that is the only instance of the class.
- Public static method that returns the instance of the class, this is the global access point for outer world to get the instance of the singleton class.
